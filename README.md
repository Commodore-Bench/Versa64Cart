Versa64Cart is designed to be a modern easy-to-use cartridge development board for Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 hobbyists and hackers.

Supported EPROMS are: 27C64 (8k), 27C128 (16k), 27C256 (32k), 27C512 (64k).
Please see the documentation for more information.


# Eagle and KiCad design files
I have put the rev 1.1 in a separate folder in case someone wants to use the kicad files as a template.
Rev. 1.2 was designed by Sven Peterson in eagle. It is a complete redrawn schematic and layout.
